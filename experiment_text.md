Thanks for getting in touch! This is for a study on visual perception about color motion and how well you can detect small differences in motion direction. I'm currently expecting the experiment to take 3-4 hours and then if you are interested you can continue in another similar study we are running. We pay $20/hr and we run the experiment in 90 minute blocks, usually over the course of a week or two. 

To get started we need to schedule an initial session where you'll come in to the lab, we'll do a quick color blindness and eye-tracking test, and then practice the experiment for a few minutes before we start the official data collection. Please don't wear any makeup on your eyes as this disrupts the eye tracker. 

Currently we have the following options open for scheduling the first session:
Fri Apr 26: any time 8am-3pm
Mon Apr 29: any time 8am-5pm

Please pick a 90 minute window and send me that information back by email. Thanks!

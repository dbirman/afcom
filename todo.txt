Fit models across the conditions all together, either fix the bias parameters, or fix the sensitivity parameters (across conditions!) 	

R^2: figure six binned data
also try generating an ideal observer model in some way to show r^2? 

Permutation test to make sure the models are actually fitting something more than zero?

Because the report direction task is closer to ceiling, we learn more from the report color task.

**mostly bias, cueing two things
